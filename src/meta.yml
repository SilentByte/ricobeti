                                    The aim of this project is streamlining humanitarian aid efforts for Nepali farmers living
                                    in remote villages by allowing them to request help using accessible, low-cost Android hardware.
                                    Following a strictly generic design philosophy, the system consists of the Android app,
                                    a backing ticketing system for managing requests for help, and a back-end server system
                                    combined with an extensible knowledge base. System is in active use in Nepal's remote regions.

                                    The goal of this project was to improve and extend an existing Online Quiz Portal intended
                                    for use at educational institutions. Tasks included security improvements, MVC refactoring,
                                    and implementation of an interactive, multiplayer-capable real-time challenge mode. A
                                    sophisticated gamification approach was introduced featuring stats and achievements.

                                    LiteCache is a lightweight, easy-to-use, and PSR-16 compliant caching library for PHP 7.0+
                                    that tries to utilize PHP's built in caching mechanisms. Advanced caching systems such as
                                    Memcached are often not available on low-cost hosting providers. However, code/opcode caching
                                    is normally enabled to speed up execution. LiteCache leverages this functionality by generating
                                    *.php files for cached objects which are then optimized and cached by the execution environment.

                                    This template-based header-only library for C++ 11 implements several composable memory allocation strategies
                                    with the goal of enabling the user to tailor memory allocation for a specific problem.
